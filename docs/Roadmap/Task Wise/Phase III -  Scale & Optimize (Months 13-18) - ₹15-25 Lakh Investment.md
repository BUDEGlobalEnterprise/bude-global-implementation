### Week 57-60: Mobile App Development (Frappe Mobile)
**Specification & Design:**
1.  **Feature Prioritization:** Decide MVP features for the app:
    *   For Freelancers: Timesheet logging, view assigned tasks, receive notifications, view earnings.
    *   For Clients: Project progress updates, approve timesheets, message freelancers.
2.  **Wireframing:** Create low-fidelity mockups for key screens (Login, Dashboard, Task List, Timesheet form).
3.  **Tech Stack Confirmation:** Finalise the use of `frappe-react` for the mobile frontend.

**Development & Integration:**
1.  **App Initialisation:** Use the `frappe-react` boilerplate to create the new app.
2.  **Authentication:** Implement login via Frappe's REST API.
3.  **Core Screens:**
    *   Build the Dashboard screen showing recent activity and stats.
    *   Build the Task List screen, fetching data from the `Task` doctype.
    *   Build a form to create and submit a `Timesheet` directly from the app.
4.  **Offline Functionality:** Implement basic offline support for timesheet logging (store data locally and sync when online).
5.  **Push Notifications:** Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to receive alerts for new assignments and messages.

### Week 61-64: Advanced Features - AI/ML Prototype
**Data Collection & Preparation:**
1.  **Identify Data Sources:** Export data from `Project`, `Freelancer Profile`, `Task`, and `Project Review` doctypes.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Anonymise client data, standardise skill labels, and handle missing values.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features for the model, such as:
    *   For freelancers: `avg_rating`, `skills_list`, `on_time_completion_rate`.
    *   For projects: `required_skills`, `complexity_score`, `budget_bracket`.

**Matching Algorithm Development:**
1.  **Model Selection:** Start with a simpler, interpretable model like a **Cosine Similarity** based recommender system.
2.  **Development:**
    *   Convert freelancer skills and project requirements into numerical vectors.
    *   Calculate similarity scores between each project and all available freelancers.
3.  **Integration:**
    *   Create a server-side method (`@frappe.whitelist`) in Frappe that takes a `Project` name and returns a ranked list of top 5 freelancer matches.
    *   Add a "Recommend Freelancers" button on the Project form that calls this method and displays the results.
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Add a simple "Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down" feedback on the recommendations to collect data for improving the model.

### Week 65-68: Process Automation Deep Dive
**Automated Client Reporting:**
1.  **Template Creation:** Design a standard client report template in Jinja (ERPNext supports this for PDF generation).

4.  **Delivery:** Configure the job to automatically email the PDF report to the client contact.

**Financial Reconciliation:**
1.  **Bank API Integration:** Explore and integrate with a bank aggregation API (like SETU or Razorpay X) to fetch bank statements automatically.
2.  **Matching Logic:** Develop a script that tries to match incoming bank transactions with existing `Payment Entry` and `Sales Invoice` records in ERPNext based on amount and date.
3.  **Exception Handling:** Create a simple UI to show unmatched transactions for manual review and reconciliation.

### Week 69-72: Performance Review & Strategy Refinement
**Comprehensive System Audit:**
1.  **Performance:** Run load tests simulating 100 concurrent users, identify and bottleneck (DB, App, Network).
2.  **Security:** Conduct a penetration test or use automated security scanning tools.
3.  **Code Quality:** Perform a code review of all custom apps, refactor messy code, and add missing comments.

**Strategic Review:**
1.  **Analyze Phase III KPIs:** Did you hit the targets for MRR, team productivity, and system uptime?
2.  **Gather Team Feedback:** Conduct one-on-ones to understand challenges and opportunities.
3.  **Update the Roadmap:** Based on everything learned, refine the plan for **Phase IV**. Do you need to pivot slightly? Double down on what's working?
4.  **Budget Review:** Analyze spending vs. budget for Phase III and prepare a detailed budget proposal for Phase IV expansion.
