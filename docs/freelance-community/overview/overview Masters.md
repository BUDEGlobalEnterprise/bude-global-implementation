Excellent idea. Now let's switch perspectives. As a freelance community using ERPNext, the master data you manage will be different from a traditional product-based company. Your "items" are services, your "customers" are clients, and your "suppliers" might be other freelancers you collaborate with.

Here is a detailed list of master data records for a freelance community using ERPNext.
